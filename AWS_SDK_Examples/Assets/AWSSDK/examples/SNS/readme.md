#AWS SDK for Unity SNS Sample

####This sample demonstrates how to use Amazon SNS with the AWS Mobile SDK for Unity and send push notifications to Android & iOS 

#####Configure the SNS Sample
Note: To run the SNS Sample you will need to create a Cognito Identity Pool, to handle authentication with AWS.  A pool can be created on the [Cognito console]( https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home).You will also need to create platform applications for Android & iOS to register the device token for iOS and Registration id for Android. The platform application can be created on the [SNS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v2/home), you can refer SNS mobile push guidelines [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePush.html). 
1. Open the SNSExample unity scene
2. Click "SNSExample" game object in "Hierarchy Pane".
3. Add "Identity Pool Id","Android Platform Arn" and "iOS Platform Arn" in "Inspector Pane". If you are using GCM you will also need to update the project id from the google console.
4. You will need google-play-services.jar & android-support-v4.jar to run this project. You can find the play services library in the location `<android-sdk>/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib/`. Import this project to eclipse and export the jar . Make sure that you use the latest version of google play services. Copy these jar files to the Assets/Plugin/Android folder in the project.
5. Open SNSExample.cs and update your cognito and sns region endpoint to the appropriate endpoints.

#####Run the sample scene
The SNS Sample can only run on the Android or iOS device. Go to File->Build Settings and switch the player to Android or iOS and Build & Run the project.
